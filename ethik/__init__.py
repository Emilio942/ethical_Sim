# This file makes the 'ethik' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty or can contain package-level initialization code.

# Optionally, to make it easier to import classes directly from the ethik package,
# you could re-export them here, e.g.:
# from .agents import NeuralEthicalAgent
# from .neural_society import NeuralEthicalSociety
# from .scenarios import EthicalScenario
# from .beliefs import NeuralEthicalBelief
# from .cognitive_architecture import CognitiveArchitecture
# from .neural_types import NeuralProcessingType
# from .constants import *
# from .analyzer import SimulationAnalyzer
# from .visualizer import SimulationVisualizer
# from .run_demo import run_simulation_and_analysis, create_example_neural_society

# For now, we'll keep it simple. Users will import from the submodules directly,
# e.g., from ethik.agents import NeuralEthicalAgent
# or from ethik.run_demo import run_simulation_and_analysis
# which is generally a cleaner approach for larger packages.
